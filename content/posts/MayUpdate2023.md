# Overview

Hello Everyone!

I am reintroducing myself as I don't think many got my first update. My name is Anis Choudhury and I will be serving as the District Secretary for our New York District this 2023-2024 year. I made this site so all the information that I provide over the year will be in one place.

The **gist** of this update is to notify clubs that have not filled out their ERFs, their April MRF, and schedule secretary meeeting. For the latter there is a google calender booking link [here](https://calendar.app.google/GTyUwNccqZwMzj8M6)

# Action Items

## Election Report Forms
- As you know the election report form is the only way for district to know what the status of your new club board is. Here are the following clubs that have still not submitted their election report forms:
    - Northern Division: 
        - St Lawrence University
        - Clarkson University
    - Empire Division:

## Secretary Meetings
- As the District Secretary I want to help you all through your secretarial duties. Therefore I would like to meet with you all in the following week. I have a google calender booking link [here](https://calendar.app.google/GTyUwNccqZwMzj8M6).
- The meeting will consist of working through the membership update center, submiting your MRF, using the master document, and more! 
- I you are not available during my specified time, email me back and I can make other arrangements.
- I dislike meeting as well so I will do my best not to waste your time.

## Monthly Report Forms
- As you also know the district needs clubs to submit their montly report forms.
- *Note: If a club has zero hours I would prefer you submit the form or email me that your club has zero hours*.
