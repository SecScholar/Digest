      <description>Overview Hello Everyone!
I am reintroducing myself as I don&amp;rsquo;t think many got my first update. My name is Anis Choudhury and I will be serving as the District Secretary for our New York District this 2023-2024 year. I made this site so all the information that I provide over the year will be in one place.
Action Items Election Report Forms As you know the election report form is the only way for district to know what the status of your new club board is.</description>
