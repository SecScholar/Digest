In Circle K there are a number of Committees that carry out tasks that are needed for the district to run. Through being in these Committees members can get to know the workings of Circle K on a district level and if you become a chair, you can lead entire parts of the district.
Note: If you become a chair, you can hold this positions while still holding a board position on the club level</description>
